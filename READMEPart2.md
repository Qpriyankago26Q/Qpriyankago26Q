Part2
**This Projects  main purpose is to:**
The user shall be able to choose whether to buy a vehicle and if the user selects vehichle the user shall be able to input the following:model and make,purchase price,total deposit,
interest rate and insurance premium.The software shall calculate the total monthly cost of buying the car.The futher calculations shall be made with outputting the expenditure in descending order.

**//Motivation:**
The main purpose of creating this project is to ensure that the user will be able to see whether they are able to qualify to purchase a vehicle with all their expenditure and to calculate these in an efficent and logical manner.

**//Build Status**
If there is an error in the program or bug which needs addressing the user does not need to waste time figuring it out the creator will be able to assist as they are familiar and know whats happeing in the code and can suggest solutions.

**//Code Style :**
This code is written in c# language  with .CS

**//Instrcutions:**
Unzip the file or program that you are currently using  .CS files needs to be complied before they can be executed.This is done primarily in Microsoft Visual Studio
Apart from  the Microsft Visual Studio ,CS FILES can be opened using any text editors like Microsoft Notepad,Apple TextEdit,Adobe Dreamweaveryo.
If you view in  Mircrosoft Visual Studio it will be placed in repost  and you must have the same frame

**//Software Plugins:**
The plugin framework is a NuGet package that allows you to customise and extend a.NET application at runtime.ASP.NET core ,WPF and WinForms  are the plugins used these can be installed 
from NuGet and also supports the delivery of plugins from NuGet.

**//Version used:**
10.0 **the most recent version of the language

**//Non Functional used:**
Accuracy,Security

**//Hardware Specs needed:
-Processor :Minimum Pentinum(|||-650MHz recommended)
-Operating system:Windows 2000 (Server pr Professional )Windows XP ,OR Windows NT 4.0 Server
-Memory :96 MB (128 recommended )for Windows 2000 Professional and 192 for Winodes 2000 Server

**//Functional Requirements:

TroubleShooting-If the project doesnt work .They would contact you .FAQs are used the most frequent are :

1.Explain how code gets compiled in C#?
Answer: It takes 4 steps to get a code to get compiled in C#. Below are the steps:

First, compile the source code in the managed code compatible with the C# compiler.
Second, combine the above newly created code into assemblies.
Third, load the CLR.
Last, execute the assembly by CLR to generate the output.

2. How you can explain the use of ‘using’ statements in C# in detail.
Answer:  The using statement is used to control the usage of one or more resources that are being used within the program. The resources are continuously consumed and released. The main function of this statement is to manage unused resources and release them automatically. Once the object is created which is using the resource and when you 
are done you make sure that the object’s dispose method is called to release the resources used by that object, this is where using statements works well.


3.How you can define the exception handling in C#?
Answer: An exception is a raised problem that may occur during the execution of the program. Handling exceptions offers a simple way to pass the control within the program whenever an exception is raised. C# exceptions are handled by using 4 keywords and those are try, catch, finally, throw.

try: a raised exception finds a particular block of code to get handled. There is no limit on the number of catch blocks that you will use in your program to handle different types of exception raised.
catch: you can handle the raised exception within this catch block. You can mention the steps that you want to do to solve the error or you can ignore the error by suppressing it by the code.
Finally: irrespective of the error, if you still want some set of instructions to get displayed then you can use those statements within the finally block and it will display it on the screen.
throw: you can throw an exception using the throw statement. It will display the type of error you are getting.
Syntax:

try {
//exception handling starts with try block
} catch( ExceptionName ea1 ) {
   // errors are handled within the catch block
} catch( ExceptionName e2 ) {
   // more catch block
} catch( ExceptionName eN ) {
   // more catch block to handle multiple exception raised
} finally {
   // last block of the exception handling
}
